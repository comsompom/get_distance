# How to Use Focal Distance App

## Getting Started

1. **Launch the App**: Open the Focal Distance app on your iPhone
2. **Grant Camera Permission**: When prompted, allow the app to access your camera
3. **Point at Target**: Point your iPhone camera at the object you want to measure (typically a person or animal)

## Step-by-Step Measurement Process

### Step 1: Tap the Top of the Object
- Look at the object through your camera view
- **Tap once** on the **top** of the object (e.g., the top of a person's head)
- You will see a **green marker** appear at the tap location
- The instruction label will change to "Tap bottom of object"

### Step 2: Tap the Bottom of the Object
- **Tap once** on the **bottom** of the object (e.g., the bottom of a person's feet or shoes)
- You will see a **red marker** appear at the tap location
- A **yellow dashed line** will connect the two markers
- A popup dialog will appear asking for the object's height

### Step 3: Enter the Object's Height
- In the popup dialog, enter the **real-world height** of the object in **meters**
- Default value is **1.7 meters** (average adult human height)
- Examples:
  - Adult human: **1.7** to **1.8** meters
  - Child: **1.0** to **1.4** meters
  - Large dog: **0.5** to **0.8** meters
  - Small dog: **0.3** to **0.5** meters
- Tap **"Calculate"** to compute the distance

### Step 4: View the Result
- The distance will be displayed at the top of the screen
- Distance is shown in **meters** and **feet**
- Example: "Distance: 5.23 meters (17.2 ft)"

## Starting a New Measurement

- Tap the **"Reset"** button in the bottom-right corner
- This clears all markers and measurements
- You can now start a new measurement

## Tips for Best Results

### Accuracy Tips
1. **Hold Steady**: Keep your iPhone as steady as possible while tapping
2. **Tap Precisely**: Try to tap exactly on the top and bottom points
3. **Know the Height**: Use an accurate height value for best results
4. **Good Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting for better camera performance
5. **Moderate Distance**: The app works best for objects between 2-20 meters away

### Common Use Cases

#### Measuring Distance to a Person
1. Point camera at the person
2. Tap the top of their head (green marker)
3. Tap the bottom of their feet (red marker)
4. Enter their height (e.g., 1.75 for 175 cm)
5. View the calculated distance

#### Measuring Distance to an Animal
1. Point camera at the animal
2. Tap the top of the animal (highest point)
3. Tap the bottom of the animal (lowest point, usually paws)
4. Enter estimated height (e.g., 0.6 for a medium dog)
5. View the calculated distance

### Troubleshooting

#### "AR Session Failed" Error
- Ensure you're using an iPhone 6s or newer
- Make sure ARKit is supported on your device
- Try restarting the app

#### Inaccurate Measurements
- Double-check that you tapped the exact top and bottom
- Verify the height value you entered is correct
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Try measuring from a different angle

#### Markers Not Appearing
- Make sure you're tapping on the camera view
- Check that the app has camera permissions
- Try resetting and starting over

#### Camera Not Working
- Check Settings > Privacy > Camera to ensure the app has permission
- Close and reopen the app
- Restart your iPhone if the problem persists

## Understanding the Display

- **Green Marker**: Indicates the top point you tapped
- **Red Marker**: Indicates the bottom point you tapped
- **Yellow Dashed Line**: Shows the measured height on screen
- **Info Label**: Displays instructions and results
- **Reset Button**: Clears current measurement

## Limitations

- Requires objects of known height
- Accuracy depends on precise tapping
- Works best in good lighting conditions
- More accurate for moderate distances (2-20 meters)
- Requires ARKit-compatible device (iPhone 6s or newer)

## Advanced Usage

For more accurate measurements:
- Measure the same object multiple times and average the results
- Use a known reference object to verify accuracy
- Ensure the object is standing straight (not leaning)
- Measure when the object is perpendicular to your line of sight
