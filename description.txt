it will be the iphone iOS application which will show on
the screen the distance to the object based on the focal
length. If we need to calibrate the camera for this before then
we need the calibration setup. Then user in the AR mode should
click on the object, lets say that all time it will be humans
or animals as soon as we know their height. It means the user
will click the human on the AR mode on the screen and set his
height and the phone must show the distance to that object.
